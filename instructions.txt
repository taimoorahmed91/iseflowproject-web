"I need you to build a web application based on these specifications. Please read all four documentation files carefully before starting:

DEVELOPER_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Start here, this is the main guide
API_SPEC.md - API endpoint specifications
DATA_STRUCTURE.md - The JSON data structure you'll be working with
FLOWCHART_LAYOUT.md - How to build the diagonal flowchart layout

Key requirements:

Next.js app deployed on Vercel
Dark theme, desktop only
Triggered by API call (not user input)
Uses React Flow for flowcharts
Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
HTTP Basic Auth on API endpoint

The GitHub repo with the data is: https://github.com/taimoorahmed91/iseflowproject
Please read through all the docs first, then let me know if you have any questions before starting. Once you're clear on everything, create the Next.js project and build according to the specs.
Focus on getting the core functionality working first:

API endpoint with auth
SSE for real-time updates
Three states (idle, loading, display)
Policy set list view
Flowchart visualization with diagonal layout

Let me know when you're ready to start or if anything is unclear."
